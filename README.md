# Sign-language-application

# signdetection
The application uses a TextView to display the translated message on the screen. The message is updated as soon as the sign is detected and translated. It also allows users to hear and delete the text



## methods
to implement this feature, we used the following steps:
In the layout XML file, we added a TextView element where the message will be displayed.
In the Java code, we found the TextView by its ID and set the text to the translated message using the setText() method.
We also used the setText() method to update the TextView with the new translated message whenever it changes.

This allows users to easily view the translated message and understand the meaning of the sign they made.
## dependencies
python 3.11

android studio

opencv 

 pip install opencv-python

tenserflow

 pip install tensorflow

 pip install pandas 


 since it's a real time  application and we need camera to detect the signs so use your phone to run the code
